What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the tracking environment used for version control when a repository is initialized. It needs to be done in order for there to be a central location for the first and subsequent commits to be rooted to.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Objects in the staging area are only transiently present. They are on their way to being committed to the repository or relegated back to the working directory. The value in this 'middle step' comes in organizing our thoughts around what exactly we are about to include or not include in a commit before making it.
